# Enigma

Self Assessment:

Functionality: 3
My encrypt and decrypt methods both work, and my CLI works as well

Object Oriented Programming: 3
The only method longer than 7 lines is the conversion_loop method, all of my classes and modules are strict to single responsibility principles, all of my classes and modules are well under 100 lines

Test Driven Development: 2
While early on my testing was at a level I would consider a 3 as the due date got close I slipped a bit on both my TDD and my testing of all methods.  My Test coverage however is at 100%

Version Control: 3
The only thing I needed to improve on my version control that I can think of is naming my pull requests better and occasionally committing multiple pieces of functionality with one commit
